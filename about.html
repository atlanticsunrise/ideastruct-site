  <h1>About IdeaStruct</h1>

  <p>
    IdeaStruct is an AI agent designed to help people turn raw ideas into
    simple, structured Lean Business Plans.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many people have ideas but struggle with fear or decision fatigue.
    IdeaStruct removes that friction by listening first and then organizing
    thoughts into a clear, consistent framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    The agent is intentionally focused. It does not provide advice, answer
    general questions, or guess facts. Its job is to create clarity at the
    earliest stage of an idea.
